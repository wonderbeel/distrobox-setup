# distrobox-setup

My quick config to set up [distrobox](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox) on various machines; it will create multiple boxes and setup various desktop entries to start them with [wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/) and [blackbox](https://gitlab.gnome.org/raggesilver/blackbox)

## Prerequisites

- `distrobox` must be installed
- `wezterm` and `blackbox` are assumed to be installed with flatpak, if you installed them in another way, you will need to edit the various `.desktop` files

## Quick setup

Just run `install.sh`, take a coffee and enjoy the setup.
